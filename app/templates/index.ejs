   </p>
   <p>
     The codon-based maximum likelihood <a href="/help/IFEL.php" class="INFO" >IFEL</a> method
     can investigate whether sequences sampled from a population (e.g. viral sequences from different hosts) have been subject to selective pressure at the 
     population level (i.e. along internal branches). A discussion of the method and its application can be found

     All six methods can also take <a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/msi031?ijkey=58b5TG2Kv933M&amp;keytype=ref" >recombination into account</a>. 
     This is done by screening the sequences for recombination breakpoints, identifying non-recombinant regions and allowing each to have its own phylogenetic tree.

       Use the <a >PRIME</a> method
       to look for site-specific aminoacid properties (e.g. charge, polarity) which are being preserved or modified by the evolutionary process. 
       For example, when a site is positively selected, evolution may be working to change side-chain volume, while maintaining polarity.

       method, developed by  <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/22/20/2493" >Konrad Scheffler and colleagues</a>, 
       extends traditional codon-based likelihood ratio tests to detect

        The <a href="help/esd.php" class="INFO" >ESD</a> method, described in  <a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/3/520" onmouseover="Tip('Mol Biol Evol 2010 27(3):520-536')" class="REFERENCE">a 2010 paper</a>, fits a versatile 
        general discrete bivariate model of site-by-site selective force variation to partition all sites into selective classes, and obtains an approximate posterior distribution of this partitioning. 
        The resulting "noisy" distribution of selective regimes is the evolutionary fingerprint of a gene. The EVF (evolutionary fingerprinting) module implements this procedure, and can also infer which individual sites appear to be
        positively selected while accounting for parameter estimation error (analogous to the BEB methodology of the PAML package).

    <h2>Detect epistasis/co-evolution</h2>
     <p>
       A Bayesian graphical model is deduced from reconstructed substitutions at each branch/site combination to infer conditional evolutionary 
       dependencies of sites in the alignments, i.e. whether a site is more or less likely to experience a non-synonymous substitution at a branch 
       when certain other sites do (or do not) experience non-synonymous substitutions at the same branch.
       The <a class="INFO" href="help/spidermonkey.php">SPIDERMONKEY</a> method was introduced in the evolutionary context in our  
       <a >paper</a>
       on the evolution of the phenotypically important and highly variable V3 loop of the envelope glycoprotein in HIV-1.

    <h2>Screen for recombination</h2>
    <p>
      Recombination leaves an imprint on sequence alignments: different segments of the alignment may be 
      described by different phylogenetic trees, called phylogenetic discordance. Datamonkey.org implements two methods: <a href="/help/Recomb.php#SBP" class="INFO" >SBP</a>, suitable for answering the question "Is there evidence of 
      recombination in the alignment?", and <a href="/help/Recomb.php#GARD" class="INFO" >GARD</a>, that attempts to find all the recombination 
      breakpoints. Both method are described in this <a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/23/10/1891" class="REFERENCE" >paper</a>. The output of GARD is accepted by most other analyses, and because recombination 
      can mislead phylogenetic analysis that do not account for it, we strongly urge that recombination testing be done on any alignment that is going to be 
      analyzed for positive selection.</p><p>You can also <a href="/dataupload_scueal.php">submit</a> a collection of HIV-1 sequences for recombination screening by a specialized recombination detection algorithm <a href="/help/scueal.php" class="INFO" >SCUEAL</a> described in this <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000581" class="REFERENCE" onmouseover="Tip('PLoS Comput Biol. 2009 Nov;5(11):e1000581;')">paper</a>.

    <h2>Perform Model Selection</h2>
    <p>
      For each type of data, nucleotide, amino-acid and codon, Datamonkey implements separate model selection procedures. An exhaustive search is performed for all possible (Markov, time-reversible) models of nucleotide 
      evolution. For protein data, a collection of published empirical models are fitted to the alignment and the best one is selected using AIC<sub>c</sub>. Finally, for coding data, a sophisticated genetic-algorithm
      procedure described in our recent <a class="REFERENCE" >paper</a>  is used to examine thousands of potential models and report the best one and various metrics based on the set of credible models - this feature is implemented in the <a onmouseover="Tip('(C)odon (M)odel (S)election')" class="INFO" href="/help/cms.php">CMS</a> module.
